# REST Permission System — Django Developer Reference

## How RestMeta Permissions Work

Every model with `RestMeta` gets automatic CRUD via `Model.on_rest_request(request, pk)`. The framework handles permission checks, list filtering, pagination, and serialization.

## Permission Flow

```
on_rest_request(request, pk)
  ├─ pk provided:
  │    GET    → on_rest_handle_get(request, instance)    → checks VIEW_PERMS on instance
  │    POST   → on_rest_handle_save(request, instance)   → checks SAVE_PERMS → VIEW_PERMS on instance
  │    DELETE  → on_rest_handle_delete(request, instance) → checks CAN_DELETE, then DELETE_PERMS → SAVE_PERMS → VIEW_PERMS on instance
  │
  └─ no pk:
       GET    → on_rest_handle_list(request)             → checks VIEW_PERMS (system-level first, then owner/group fallback)
       POST   → on_rest_handle_create(request)           → checks SAVE_PERMS → VIEW_PERMS
```

## RestMeta Properties

| Property | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `VIEW_PERMS` | `[]` | Permissions needed to view/list. Empty = public. |
| `SAVE_PERMS` | `[]` | Permissions needed to create/update. Falls back to VIEW_PERMS if empty. |
| `DELETE_PERMS` | `[]` | Permissions needed to delete. Falls back to SAVE_PERMS → VIEW_PERMS. |
| `CREATE_PERMS` | `[]` | Permissions needed to create (POST without pk). Falls back to SAVE_PERMS. |
| `CAN_DELETE` | `False` | Must be `True` for DELETE to work at all. |
| `NO_REST_SAVE` | `False` | Blocks POST/PUT entirely. |
| `NO_REST` | `False` | Blocks all REST operations. |
| `OWNER_FIELD` | `"user"` | FK field name pointing to the owning user. Used with `"owner"` perm. |
| `GROUP_FIELD` | `"group"` | FK field name pointing to the owning group. |

## Special Permission Strings

| String | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"all"` | No authentication required (public) |
| `"authenticated"` | Any logged-in user |
| `"owner"` | The instance's `OWNER_FIELD` matches `request.user` |
| Any other string | Checked via `request.user.has_permission(perm)` |

## The "owner" Permission

`"owner"` is a special string in permission lists. It enables user-scoped access:

### For detail (GET/PUT/DELETE with pk):
`rest_check_permission` checks `instance.{OWNER_FIELD}.id == request.user.id`. If the requesting user owns the instance, permission is granted.

### For list (GET without pk):
`on_rest_handle_list` has a fallback path. If the user doesn't have system-level permissions but `"owner"` is in `VIEW_PERMS`, it filters the queryset: `Model.objects.filter({OWNER_FIELD}=request.user)`.

**The flow is:**
1. Try system-level perm check (e.g., does user have `"view_admin"`?)
2. If YES → `on_rest_list(request)` with **all** objects (admin sees everything)
3. If NO and `"owner"` in VIEW_PERMS → `on_rest_list(request, filtered_queryset)` with **owner's objects only**
4. If NO and model has `group` field → check group-level permissions, filter by groups
5. Otherwise → 403 or empty list

### Example: Owner-scoped with admin override

```python
class Conversation(models.Model, MojoModel):
    user = models.ForeignKey("account.User", on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class RestMeta:
        VIEW_PERMS = ["view_admin", "owner"]
        OWNER_FIELD = "user"
        CAN_DELETE = True
```

- User with `view_admin` → sees all conversations, can delete any
- User without `view_admin` but is owner → sees only their own, can delete their own
- User without `view_admin` and not owner → 403

### Example: Owner-only (no admin override)

```python
class UserNote(models.Model, MojoModel):
    user = models.ForeignKey("account.User", on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class RestMeta:
        VIEW_PERMS = ["owner"]
        SAVE_PERMS = ["owner"]
        OWNER_FIELD = "user"
```

- Only the owning user can see, create, and edit their notes
- No admin override

## Group-Scoped Permissions

When a model has a `group` FK and the user doesn't have system-level permissions, the framework checks if the user has the required permissions within any group:

```python
groups_with_perms = request.user.get_groups_with_permission(perms)
queryset.filter(group__in=groups_with_perms)
```

The `request.group` context is set automatically when an instance has a `group` attribute.

## Delete Gating

DELETE requires two checks:
1. `CAN_DELETE = True` (model-level gate — without this, DELETE always returns 403)
2. Permission check: `DELETE_PERMS` → falls back to `SAVE_PERMS` → falls back to `VIEW_PERMS`

The permission check passes the `instance`, so `"owner"` works for delete too.

## NO_REST_SAVE

When `NO_REST_SAVE = True`, POST/PUT are blocked. This is for models where mutations happen through service functions (not direct REST save). GET (list/detail) and DELETE (if `CAN_DELETE = True`) still work normally.

## Standard CRUD Endpoint Pattern

```python
from mojo import decorators as md
from myapp.models import MyModel

@md.URL('mymodel')
@md.URL('mymodel/<int:pk>')
@md.uses_model_security(MyModel)
def on_mymodel(request, pk=None):
    return MyModel.on_rest_request(request, pk)
```

`@md.uses_model_security(Model)` is required — it sets up the permission context. Do NOT add `@md.requires_auth()` alongside it (VIEW_PERMS handles auth).

## Graphs

Graphs control serialization — what fields are included in the response.

```python
GRAPHS = {
    "default": {
        "fields": ["id", "title", "created"],
    },
    "detail": {
        "fields": ["id", "title", "metadata", "created", "modified"],
        "extra": ["computed_field"],        # @property on the model
        "graphs": {"user": "basic"},        # serialize user FK with "basic" graph
    },
    "list": {
        "fields": ["id", "title"],
    },
}
```

- `"fields"` — model fields to include
- `"extra"` — `@property` names on the model (computed/virtual fields)
- `"graphs"` — related object serialization: `{field_name: graph_name}`

The client selects a graph via `?graph=detail`. Default is `"default"`.

For list endpoints, the framework uses `"list"` graph if it exists, otherwise `"default"`.

## FK Assignment During Save

When a save payload assigns a ForeignKey field by primary key — e.g. `data={"group": 5}` — the framework looks up the target via `field.related_model.objects.get(pk=value)` and then runs `field.related_model.rest_check_permission(request, "VIEW_PERMS", related_instance)` before assigning. On denial the assignment is silently skipped (the parent save proceeds with the field unchanged) and an incident event is recorded by `rest_check_permission`.

This prevents cross-model privilege escalation: a user with SAVE_PERMS on model A but no view access to model B cannot attach B records to A. The same gate has always applied when the value is a dict (which triggers a cascading save and additionally requires SAVE_PERMS on the target).

Cases that do **not** require VIEW_PERMS on the target:

| Case | Reason |
|---|---|
| Self-reference (`a.parent = a.pk`) | Caller already authorized for self |
| Clear (`group=0` / `None` / `""`) | No target to view |
| Related model is non-MojoModel (no `rest_check_permission`) | Framework only gates models that opt in |
